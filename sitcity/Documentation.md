##  Challenges & Lessons Learned

One of the most challenging parts of this project was building the **Hero section**.

Due to its complex design, adapting it for mobile responsiveness became difficult. Early design decisions made for larger screens caused layout issues on smaller devices.

To resolve this, the Hero section had to be **rebuilt from scratch**. Although the visual changes were subtle, the refactor required significant time and effort.

**Key lessons learned:**

* Avoid design shortcuts during early stages
* Plan responsiveness from the start
* Clean structure saves time in the long run

##  Future Improvements

* Add product filtering and categories
* Optimize animations for lower-end devices
* Introduce backend integration for dynamic content
